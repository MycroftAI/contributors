# Skill Testing Team

Our Skill Testing Team are responsible for the [Skills Acceptance Process](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/skills-acceptance-process/). They review all Skills submitted for inclusion to the [Mycroft Marketplace](https://market.mycroft.ai), ensuring that our Skills are secure, stable, accurate, and intuitive.

They are a friendly and helpful team of Community members, always eager to provide tangible advice to Skill Authors.

Team members conduct one or more reviews on incoming pull requests. These include:
- Code review - ensuring the code is stable and secure
- Information review - ensuring all info is accurate and understandable
- Functional review - ensuring the experience of using the Skill is intuitive  

The type of review they choose depends on each members personal skills and interests.
